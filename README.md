# magic
A package for R language that will bestow users with magical data analytic capabilities. This is mainly to allow researchers at the Cambridge Prosociality and Well-being Lab to focus more on collaborative research and less on doing silly gruntwork.

# installation
The easiest way to get some `magic` on your computer, please type the following to your R console:

    install.packages("devtools")
    require("devtools")

    install_github("magic", "vanderlowe")
    require("magic")

This should get you rolling. These tools are under development, so try re-installing if you are not feeling the `magic`.
